                                    Hello there! Iâ€™m Praise and let me tell you,
                                    I'm all about snacks, whether it's fried,
                                    boiled, smoked, or raw; â€˜Bros Otilorâ€™
                                    <span
                                        role="img"
                                        className="wave"
                                        aria-label="wave"
                                    >
                                        ðŸ˜„
                                    </span>
                                    . My strongest hobby is adding color and
                                    creativity to the world, pixel after pixel.
                                </p>

                                    With a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and
                                    JavaScript, I am always excited to dive into
                                    React and leverage its power to bring the
                                    wireframe of the UI/UX designer to life with
                                    any necessary technology or library like
                                    Framer Motion, Tailwind CSS, and Redux
                                    toolkit among others; as well as integrating
                                    APIs and collaborating cohesively with the
                                    backend team.
